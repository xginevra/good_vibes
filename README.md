## What is Psoriasis?

Psoriasis is a chronic, proliferative and inflammatory disease which mostly affects the skin. Once it appears, most people 
discover reddish and scaly spots firstly on their elbows and knees. As the disease develops, the spots grow and spread all over the body. 
The involved areas are itchy and tend to bleed after scratching. Also, psoriasis can affect the joints and eyes, but the most
common type is the plaque type which appears on the skin. There is no cure for psoriasis, and what's more, it goes down and up in episodes.
It is important to mention that the disease is not contagious. It is considered as an autoimmune disease.

## Living with Psoriasis - is it easy?

There is more than just the itchy skin with plaque on it, and it is not easy to live with it at all.
Psoriasis is a very obvious disease, it is difficult to hide it unless one wants to fully cover their body when going out.
People tend to stare and point the finger on someone who looks different. Furthermore, suffering from psoriasis does affect the
everyday life by being painful when it comes to movements which include the affected areas of the body, e.g. walking if the knees are
affected by plaque. In addition, there is the need to scratch the afflicted areas due to the itching, which, among other things, 
makes people with psoriasis spread their dandruff at every place they sit or lay down. This might not be bad in general, since everyone has 
a vacuum or something else, but for the person themselves it can be a range from emberassing to really depressing.
Depressing is the key word for the next topic which comes up when talking about psoriasis - depression.
Psoriasis affects the entire life of a person. Rejection from other people who don't know the disease, the decreased life quality
and the whole process of seeing doctors, not to know if it ends someday can lead to 
depressions and even suicide.
